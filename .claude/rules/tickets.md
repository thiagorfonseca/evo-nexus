# Tickets — Persistent Conversation & Work Threads

Persistent topics with state, assignable to agents, with atomic checkout. Primary inbox for heartbeat-driven agents.

## Model

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | UUID string |
| `title`, `description` | Text, description optional |
| `status` | `open` / `in_progress` / `blocked` / `review` / `resolved` / `closed` (CHECK enum) |
| `priority` | `urgent` / `high` / `medium` / `low` |
| `assignee_agent` | agent slug (`zara-cs`, `flux-finance`, ...) |
| `project_id`, `goal_id` | Optional links to Goals (F1.2) |
| `locked_at`, `locked_by` | Atomic checkout state |
| `lock_timeout_seconds` | Default 1800 — janitor releases after this |

Comments: `ticket_comments` (author = `human:x` or `agent:y`).
Activity log: `ticket_activity` (events: created, status_changed, checkout, release, assigned, comment_added, deleted).

## Atomic Checkout

```sql
UPDATE tickets
SET locked_at = now(), locked_by = ?, lock_timeout_seconds = ?
WHERE id = ? AND locked_at IS NULL
```

Row count = 1 → got the lock. Row count = 0 → already locked (409 Conflict returned).

Guarantees: exactly one process acts on a ticket at a time. Verified by concurrency test (10 parallel requests → 1 wins, 9 get 409).

## Auto-Release (Janitor)

`dashboard/backend/ticket_janitor.py` runs every 5 minutes:
- `SELECT id FROM tickets WHERE locked_at IS NOT NULL AND datetime(locked_at, '+' || lock_timeout_seconds || ' seconds') < now()`
- For each, clear lock + log activity (`actor='system:janitor'`)

Prevents orphaned locks from crashed runs.

## Mentions

Comment body with `@agent-slug` (regex `@([a-z0-9-]+)`):
- Parser matches against known agent slugs (`.claude/agents/*.md`)
- For each mention with an enabled heartbeat: insert `heartbeat_triggers` row with `trigger_type='mention'`
- Dispatcher wakes the agent on next debounce window (30s)

## Tickets vs Sessions

| | Ticket | Session |
|---|---|---|
| Lifetime | Days / weeks | Single conversation |
| State | 6 workflow states | Open / closed |
| Persistence | DB-first | JSONL logs |
| Inbox | Yes (heartbeat step 3) | No |
| Use when | Recurring topic | Ephemeral exploration |

Sessions can attach to tickets via `sessions.ticket_id` (optional). Chat UI offers dropdown to attach on create.

## UI

- `/issues` — global list with filters (status, priority, assignee, project, goal, search)
- `/tickets/{id}` — detail view with merged timeline (comments + activity + status changes)

### Actions

- **List**: create new, bulk close / delete / reopen / reassign / relink goal
- **Detail**: edit title, change status, change priority, add comment, release lock, delete

## API

```
GET    /api/tickets                  # list with filters
GET    /api/tickets/{id}             # single with relations
GET    /api/tickets/{id}/timeline    # merged events
POST   /api/tickets                  # create
PATCH  /api/tickets/{id}             # update fields
DELETE /api/tickets/{id}             # delete (logs activity)
POST   /api/tickets/{id}/checkout    # atomic lock
POST   /api/tickets/{id}/release     # release lock (403 if wrong agent)
POST   /api/tickets/{id}/comments    # add comment, parse mentions
POST   /api/tickets/bulk             # close/reopen/delete/reassign/relink_goal
GET    /api/tickets/export.csv       # CSV export
```

## Heartbeat Inbox Integration

```python
# dashboard/backend/ticket_inbox.py
def get_inbox_for_agent(agent_slug, limit=10):
    """Tickets assigned to agent, ordered by priority DESC, created_at ASC."""
    # Used by heartbeat_runner.py step 3
```

Query used by heartbeats:
```sql
SELECT * FROM tickets
WHERE assignee_agent = ?
  AND status IN ('open','in_progress')
  AND locked_at IS NULL
ORDER BY
  CASE priority WHEN 'urgent' THEN 4 WHEN 'high' THEN 3 WHEN 'medium' THEN 2 ELSE 1 END DESC,
  created_at ASC
LIMIT ?
```

## Retro-Tickets Script

`scripts/suggest_retro_tickets.py` scans existing chat sessions and proposes tickets to create from recurring topics. Output: `workspace/development/features/tickets/[C]retro-tickets-suggestions.csv`. Davidson reviews manually — no auto-creation.

## Related Rules

- `heartbeats.md` — tickets feed the inbox in step 3
- `goals.md` — tickets can link to goals via `goal_id`
