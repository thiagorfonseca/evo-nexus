# Daily Community Pulse

Daily routine that reads Discord and WhatsApp messages from the last 24h and generates an HTML community health report.

**Always respond in English.**

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Collect Discord data

Use the `/discord-get-messages` skill to fetch messages from the last 24h in the main channels:

Channels to monitor (Guild ID: `YOUR_GUILD_ID`):
- `💬・chat-pt` — chat principal PT
- `💬・chat-en` — chat principal EN
- `💬・chat-es` — chat principal ES
- `🆘・help` — suporte
- `🆘・feedback` — feedback
- `💡・suggestions` — suggestions
- `💎・showcase` — showcase
- `📢・news` — news

For each channel, fetch the last 100 messages and filter those from the last 24h.

### Step 1b — Collect WhatsApp data

Use the `/int-whatsapp` skill to fetch messages from the last 24h:

```bash
python3 {project-root}/.claude/skills/int-whatsapp/scripts/whatsapp_client.py messages_24h
```

And also the statistics:
```bash
python3 {project-root}/.claude/skills/int-whatsapp/scripts/whatsapp_client.py stats --start $(date -u -v-1d '+%Y-%m-%d') --end $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d')
```

Extract: total messages, active groups, unique participants, discussed topics, support questions.

### Step 2 — Analyze

From the collected messages, calculate:

1. **Activity**: total messages (Discord + WhatsApp separate), unique active members, most active channel/group
2. **New members**: check `🆕・new-members` for entries today
3. **Support**: unanswered questions in `🆘・help` (Discord) + questions in WhatsApp groups, time without response
4. **Sentiment**: analyze the overall tone (positive/neutral/negative) based on content from both platforms
5. **Top topics**: group by theme the most frequent discussions from Discord + WhatsApp (maximum 6)
6. **WhatsApp**: active groups, total messages, unique participants, topics — separate section in the report
7. **Overall health**: Normal (>80% positive, <3 open questions), Attention (mixed sentiment or 3-5 open questions), Critical (negative sentiment or >5 unanswered questions)

### Step 3 — Generate HTML report

Read the template at `.claude/templates/html/custom/community-daily-pulse.html`.

Replace the placeholders `{{...}}` with the actual collected data.

Evolution logo available at: `workspace/projects/Evolution Foundation/Logos finais/Favicon logo/SVG/Favicon Color 500.svg`

Save the filled HTML to:
```
workspace/community/reports/daily/[C] YYYY-MM-DD-community-pulse.html
```

Create directory if it does not exist.

### Step 4 — Terminal summary

Present a short summary in the terminal:

```
## Daily Pulse — {date}

Health: {Normal/Attention/Critical}
Messages: {N} | Active: {N} | New: {N}
Support: {N} unanswered
Sentiment: {emoji} {label}
Top: {topic 1}, {topic 2}, {topic 3}

Report saved to workspace/community/reports/daily/
```

## Rules

- **Do not reply to messages on Discord** — only read and analyze
- **Sentiment based on real content** — do not guess, analyze the messages
- **Unanswered questions = priority** — always highlight
- **Compare with average** — if previous reports exist in the directory, compare metrics
- **Empty channels = OK** — if a channel had no activity, do not report as a problem
