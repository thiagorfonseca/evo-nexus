# Email Triage & Prioritization

Efficiently review and prioritize your inbox by classifying emails and suggesting actions.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User wants to "review my inbox" or "check my email"
- User asks to "triage emails" or "prioritize messages"
- User mentions "what's urgent" or "what needs my attention"
- User wants help deciding what to do with emails
- At the start of workday for inbox review

**Important**: This skill is READ-ONLY. It analyzes and proposes actions but NEVER sends, archives, or modifies emails.

## Dynamic Context

The following live data is available:

**Unread emails:**
```
!`gog gmail search "is:unread" --max 25 --json 2>/dev/null || echo "GOG_NOT_CONFIGURED"`
```

## Inputs You Need

Before triaging:
1. **User preferences** (ask if not known):
   - Categories of interest (work vs personal filter)
   - Urgency threshold (show only high/urgent, or include all)
   - Any auto-archive patterns (newsletters, notifications)

2. **Context clues** (extract from conversation):
   - Current projects or priorities
   - Upcoming deadlines
   - People user is waiting to hear from

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Unread Emails

If dynamic context shows `GOG_NOT_CONFIGURED`:
- Inform user that GOG is not configured
- Point to: `skills/gog/_shared/references/gog-interface.md`
- Offer to help with configuration
- STOP here until configured

If email list is empty:
- Inform user: "No unread emails! Inbox Zero achieved."
- Ask if they want to review recent emails instead
- If yes, fetch: `gog gmail search "is:inbox" --max 25 --json`

### Step 2: Analyze Each Email

For each email, determine:

**Urgency Level:**
- **urgent**: Immediate attention required (< 2 hours)
  - Keywords: "urgent", "ASAP", "immediately", "emergency"
  - From: Boss, critical clients, system alerts
  - Context: Blocking your work or others
- **high**: Should respond today
  - Action required by EOD
  - Meeting invitations for soon
  - Client/stakeholder requests
- **medium**: Can respond within 2-3 days
  - FYI with potential follow-up
  - Non-urgent requests
  - Team updates that may need input
- **low**: No time pressure
  - Newsletters, automated reports
  - Social correspondence
  - Informational only

**Category:**
- **action-required**: Needs a decision or action from you
- **fyi**: Informational only, no action needed
- **meeting**: Meeting invitation or scheduling
- **social**: Personal correspondence
- **newsletter**: Automated newsletters/updates
- **spam**: Likely spam or unwanted

**Suggested Action:**
- **reply**: Draft a reply (use gog-email-draft skill)
- **reply-all**: Draft reply-all
- **forward**: Forward to someone else
- **archive**: No action needed, remove from inbox
- **create-task**: Convert to task (use gog-tasks skill)
- **schedule-meeting**: Set up meeting (use gog-calendar skill)
- **block-sender**: Mark as spam/block
- **delete**: Junk, delete immediately

### Step 3: Generate Triage Summary

Output in this format:

```markdown
# Email Triage Summary

📧 **Total Unread**: [N] messages
⚠️  **Urgent**: [N] | 🔴 **High**: [N] | 🟡 **Medium**: [N] | 🟢 **Low**: [N]

## Top 3 Priorities

1. **[Subject]** from [Sender]
   - Urgency: [urgent/high/medium/low]
   - Reason: [1-line rationale]
   - Suggested action: [action]

2. [...]

3. [...]

## All Messages

| ID (last 6) | From | Subject (truncated) | Urgency | Category | Action | Rationale |
|-------------|------|---------------------|---------|----------|--------|-----------|
| abc123 | sender@example.com | Meeting tomorrow? | high | meeting | reply | Needs response by EOD |
| def456 | newsletter@... | Weekly update | low | newsletter | archive | FYI only |
| [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] |

## Suggested Next Actions

- [ ] **Reply to [N] urgent/high priority emails** (IDs: abc123, def456)
- [ ] **Create tasks for [N] action items** (IDs: ghi789)
- [ ] **Schedule meeting for [topic]** (ID: jkl012)
- [ ] **Archive [N] newsletters and FYI messages**
- [ ] **Block [N] spam senders**

---

**Next Steps**:
- To draft a reply: "Draft a reply to [email ID or subject]"
- To create task: "Create a task for [email ID or subject]"
- To schedule meeting: "Schedule meeting about [topic]"
- To see email content: "Show me email [ID]"
```

### Step 4: Save HTML Artifact

Read the template at `.claude/templates/html/custom/email-triage.html`, fill all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values with the data from Step 3 (email counts, priority groups, suggested actions), and save the completed HTML to `workspace/daily-logs/[C] YYYY-MM-DD-email-triage.html`.

Create the `workspace/daily-logs/` directory if it does not exist.

### Step 5: Offer Follow-Up

After presenting the triage:
- Ask: "Which email would you like to tackle first?"
- Or: "Would you like me to draft replies for the top priorities?"
- Or: "Should I create tasks for the action items?"

**Do NOT** proceed to take actions without user confirmation.

## Output Format (Strict)

The triage summary MUST include:

1. **Header stats**: Total count + urgency breakdown
2. **Top 3 priorities**: Most urgent/important emails with rationale
3. **Complete table**: All emails with classifications
4. **Suggested next actions**: Checklist of proposed actions grouped by type
5. **Next steps prompt**: Clear options for follow-up

**Table columns** (in order):
1. ID (last 6 chars) - for reference
2. From - sender email or name
3. Subject (truncated to ~40 chars)
4. Urgency - urgent/high/medium/low
5. Category - action-required/fyi/meeting/social/newsletter/spam
6. Action - reply/archive/create-task/etc
7. Rationale - 1-line explanation

## Examples

### Example 1: Morning Inbox Review

**User**: "Review my inbox"

**Assistant**:
```
Let me triage your unread emails.

[Fetches emails...]

   - Urgency: urgent
   - Reason: Blocks Q2 planning, needs approval by noon today
   - Suggested action: reply

2. **Client demo tomorrow** from client@acme.com
   - Urgency: high
   - Reason: Meeting in < 24h, needs confirmation of attendees

- [ ] **Archive 3 newsletters** (IDs: 4c9e2f, 6a3d8b, 1f7c5e)

---

**Next Steps**: Which email would you like to tackle first? I can draft replies for the top priorities or create tasks for follow-up items.
```

### Example 2: Filtered Triage

**User**: "Show me only urgent and high priority emails"

**Assistant**:
```
Let me filter for urgent and high priority emails only.

[Fetches and filters...]

# Email Triage Summary (Urgent + High Only)

📧 **Total Unread**: 12 messages (showing 4 urgent/high)
⚠️  **Urgent**: 1 | 🔴 **High**: 3

## Top Priorities

1. **Budget approval needed** from sarah@company.com
   - Urgency: urgent
   - Action: reply
   [...]

[Table with only urgent/high priority emails]

The remaining 8 emails are medium/low priority. Want to see those too?
```

## Failure Modes / Troubleshooting

### GOG Not Configured

**Symptom**: Dynamic context shows `GOG_NOT_CONFIGURED`

**Resolution**:
1. Inform user: "GOG CLI is not configured. Let me help you set it up."
2. Point to: `skills/gog/_shared/references/gog-interface.md`
3. Suggest: "Run `gog auth login` to authenticate"
4. Do not proceed with triage until configured

### No Unread Emails

**Symptom**: Email list is empty `[]`

**Resolution**:
1. Celebrate: "Inbox Zero! No unread emails."
2. Ask: "Want to review recent emails instead?"
3. If yes, fetch last 25 emails without unread filter

### Invalid JSON from GOG

**Symptom**: `jq parse error` or non-JSON output

**Resolution**:
1. Try without `--json` flag
2. Parse human-readable output (less reliable)
3. Or inform user: "GOG output format unexpected. Please check GOG version."

### Too Many Emails (> 25)

**Symptom**: User has 100+ unread emails

**Resolution**:
1. Inform: "You have [N] unread emails. Showing top 25."
2. Suggest: "Want to filter by sender, date, or keyword?"
3. Or: "Let's focus on urgent/high priority only"
4. Consider batching: "Let's triage in batches of 25"

### Classification Uncertainty

**Symptom**: Can't determine urgency or category from email metadata

**Resolution**:
1. Fetch full email with `gog email get --id <id>`
2. Read first ~200 chars of body for context
3. If still uncertain, default to "medium" urgency and "action-required" category
4. Note in rationale: "Needs review to determine priority"

## Safety Rules

1. **Never send, archive, or delete emails** - This skill is READ-ONLY
2. **Never modify email labels or folders** - Only analyze and propose
3. **Always propose, never execute** - Present options, user decides
4. **Privacy-aware output** - Truncate email subjects in output if they appear sensitive
5. **No automation without consent** - Even for "obvious" spam, ask before suggesting block/delete

## Safe Test

To safely test this skill using only `user@example.com`:

**Read-only test (always safe):**
```bash
gog gmail search "is:unread (to:user@example.com OR from:user@example.com)" --max 10 --json
```

**In Claude Code**:
1. Load the gog-email-triage skill
2. Say: "Triage my inbox"
3. Skill will fetch unread emails
4. Verify output includes:
   - Email count and urgency breakdown
   - Top 3 priorities with rationale
   - Complete table with all emails
   - Suggested next actions checklist
5. Confirm NO emails are sent, archived, or modified

See `skills/gog/_shared/references/testing.md` for complete test plan.

## Notes

- This skill integrates with:
  - `gog-email-draft`: For drafting replies to prioritized emails
  - `gog-tasks`: For converting emails to tasks
  - `gog-calendar`: For scheduling meetings mentioned in emails
  - `gog-followups`: For tracking emails awaiting responses

- Consider user's timezone when assessing urgency (EOD means their EOD)

- If email subject/sender contains obvious credentials or secrets, redact in output

- For recurring newsletters, suggest creating a filter/rule rather than manual archiving
